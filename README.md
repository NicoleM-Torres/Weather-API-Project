Objective:

Create a 7-day weather forecast website using the National Weather Service (weather.gov) API. The project will involve fetching weather data, displaying the forecast for a specified location, and enhancing the user interface using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript.

Project Overview:
The website will provide users with a 7-day weather forecast based on their input location.
Data will be fetched from the weather.gov API, parsed, and displayed dynamically on the page.
The site will include basic error handling and a responsive design suitable for various devices.
Key Features:
Display Forecast Data:
Show the 7-day weather forecast, including the day of the week, temperature (high and low), weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy), and an icon representing the weather.
Data Fetching:
Use the weather.gov API to retrieve forecast data for the entered location.
Handle API requests and parse the JSON data to extract relevant weather information.
Responsive Design:

Error Handling:
Manage common errors, such as invalid location input, API errors, or network failures, and display appropriate error messages to the user.
Technical Requirements:
Technologies:
Frontend: HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript.
